#### How can we make scientific poster sessions more accessible to scientists with disabilities?


[Our study](https://figshare.com/articles/poster/Conference_presentation_accessibility/21892881) of 400+ conference attendees uncoverd:
* Many scientists attending academic meetings have invisible accessibility needs
* People often have multiple accessibility needs (mobility and vision inpairment)
* The billboard-style "betterposter v1.5" was rated as the most accessible
* People with mobility needs really just wanted a place to sit down
